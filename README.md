## LLMs / Models

* [PygmalionAI](https://github.com/PygmalionAI) - 
All models: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI), Most popular of which as of October 2023 is [Mythalion 13B](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI/mythalion-13b) - A merge of Pygmalion-2 13B and MythoMax 13B

* [MythoMax 13B](https://huggingface.co/Gryphe/MythoMax-L2-13b) - by Gryphe. Uncensored.

* [Manticore-13B](https://huggingface.co/mindrage/Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML) - Uncensored.

* [SynthIA](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Synthia-7B-v1.3-GGUF) - Uncensored, trained on Mistral

* [CalliopeDS](https://huggingface.co/Doctor-Shotgun/CalliopeDS-L2-13B) - This is a Llama 2-based model consisting of a merge of several models using a weight-adjusted TIES merge (Resolving Interference When Merging Models): jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-2.2, elinas/chronos-13b-v2, NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b, lemonilia/limarp-llama2-v2,   PygmalionAI/pygmalion-2-13b.

* [Ayumi's LLM Role Play & ERP Ranking (NSFW)](https://rentry.co/ayumi_erp_rating)

* [Wiki by r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/wiki/models/)

For awareness, the scores are NOT representative of quality of prose, performance across the entire context window (i.e. ability to effectively recall information accurately), stability (i.e. logical flow, coherence) and actual RP performance. There are many models that score well that perform very poorly with actual use 
For example, in October 2023, Mythomax scores worse, but is better than a majority of the models that score better than it.

Recommendations for levels:

    7b: Mistral and its variants, especially Mistral-OpenOrca and Mistral-instruct
    13b: Mythomax and its variants, Athena
    33b: Airoboros, Chronoboros
    20b: Emerhyst, MLewd-remm-l2-chat
    70b+: Xwin, Synthia 1.2
