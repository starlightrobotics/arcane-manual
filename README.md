## LLMs / Models

* [PygmalionAI](https://github.com/PygmalionAI) - 
All models: [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI), Most popular of which as of October 2023 is [Mythalion 13B](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI/mythalion-13b) - A merge of Pygmalion-2 13B and MythoMax 13B

* [MythoMax 13B](https://huggingface.co/Gryphe/MythoMax-L2-13b) - by Gryphe. Uncensored.

* [Manticore-13B](https://huggingface.co/mindrage/Manticore-13B-Chat-Pyg-Guanaco-GGML) - Uncensored.

* [SynthIA](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Synthia-7B-v1.3-GGUF) - Uncensored, trained on Mistral

* [CalliopeDS](https://huggingface.co/Doctor-Shotgun/CalliopeDS-L2-13B) - This is a Llama 2-based model consisting of a merge of several models using a weight-adjusted TIES merge (Resolving Interference When Merging Models): jondurbin/airoboros-l2-13b-2.2, elinas/chronos-13b-v2, NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b, lemonilia/limarp-llama2-v2,   PygmalionAI/pygmalion-2-13b.

**Language-Vision models**

* LLaVA - trained on LLaMA 2
* BakLLaVA-1 - fine-tuned on Mistral


## LLMs / Lists and Ranking

For awareness, the scores are NOT representative of quality of prose, performance across the entire context window (i.e. ability to effectively recall information accurately), stability (i.e. logical flow, coherence) and actual RP performance. There are many models that score well that perform very poorly with actual use 
For example, in October 2023, Mythomax scores worse, but is better than a majority of the models that score better than it.

Recommendations for levels as of October 2023:

    7b: Mistral and its variants, especially Mistral-OpenOrca and SynthIA - Mistral-7B in some cases already outperforms GPT-3.5
    13b: Mythomax and its variants, Athena
    20b: Emerhyst, MLewd-remm-l2-chat
    33b: Airoboros, Chronoboros
    70b+: Xwin, Synthia 1.5 - 70B outperform GPT-3.5 and rival GPT4


## LLMs / UIs and WebUIs

Some of the UIs, like SillyTavern, also have APIs, that can be used for own coding projects and automation.

#### [Kobold.CPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)
 <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
      KoboldCpp is an easy-to-use AI text-generation software for GGML models. It's a single self contained distributable from Concedo, that builds off llama.cpp, and adds a versatile Kobold API endpoint, additional format support, backward compatibility, as well as a fancy UI with persistent stories, editing tools, save formats, memory, world info, author's note, characters, scenarios and everything Kobold and Kobold Lite have to offer.
</details>


#### [KoboldAI Client](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client)
 <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
From providing user donated backends as workers, and providing an application interface for running all sort of models - it is PygmalionAI's pick for running models locally.

Website: [KoboldAI](https://koboldai.org/pygmalion)
</details>

#### [TavernAI](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI)
 <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
The original frontend. It lacks the options for the user on their chatting experience, however it is still very usable.
</details>

#### [Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) - Front-End
 <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Oobabooga is a web interface, in the same look as Stable Diffusion Web UI by Automatic1111. It has more features, and compatibility compared to KoboldAI running models locally.

#### [SillyTavern](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) - Power-user Front-End
 <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
An open-source frontend for running LLM models. Provides all the tools to customize your chatting experience. An extensive modification of TavernAI.

#### [oterm](https://github.com/ggozad/oterm) - CLI UI

## Personality specifications for AIs

Sample prompts and character sheets by [Botprompts](https://botprompts.net/)

#### W++
The format example:

Personality ( "cute" + "gentle" + "intelligent" + "etc" ) Loves ( "food" + "etc" ) 

#### Natural language
